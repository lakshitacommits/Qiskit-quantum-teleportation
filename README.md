🧠 About this Project

This project implements Quantum Teleportation using Qiskit, IBM’s open-source quantum computing SDK.
Quantum teleportation is a protocol that transfers a quantum state from one qubit to another using entanglement and classical communication, without physically moving the particle itself.

⚙️ What the Code Does

Creates a 3-qubit quantum circuit

Prepares an arbitrary quantum state on the first qubit

Generates an entangled Bell pair between the second and third qubits

Performs Bell-state measurements

Applies conditional operations (X, Z gates) based on the measured classical bits

Simulates the process using Qiskit Aer backends and visualizes measurement results

🧩 Tools & Libraries

Qiskit (QuantumCircuit, Aer)

Matplotlib for visualization

NumPy for numerical operations
